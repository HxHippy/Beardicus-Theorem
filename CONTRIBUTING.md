- Specify your beard status (optional but appreciated)

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements

- Focus on the scope of the theorem
- Provide mathematical justification
- Consider edge cases (e.g., clean-shaven users with cute avatars)
- Account for various Medieval Fantasy Dwarf characteristics

### 3. Code Contributions

#### Areas of Interest

1. **Mathematical Models**
   - Refinements to beard prominence calculations
   - Alternative Medieval Fantasy Dwarf probability functions
   - New correlations with other variables

2. **Visualization**

   - Translation to other languages

## 💻 Style Guidelines

### Python Code

```python
# Use descriptive variable names
cuteness_level = 8.5
beard_prominence = calculate_beard_prominence(cuteness_level)

# Document functions properly
def calculate_Medieval_Fantasy_Dwarf_probability(cuteness_level):
    """
    Calculate the probability of being a Medieval Fantasy Dwarf.
    
    Args:
        cuteness_level (float): The cuteness level of the anime avatar (0-10)
    
    Returns:
        float: Probability value between 0 and 1
    """
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(cuteness_level - 8)))
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include mathematical notation where appropriate
- Add examples for complex concepts

## 🔄 Development Process
