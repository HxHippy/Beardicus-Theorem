# Dr. Beardicus' Theorem: The Tale of Anime Avatars and Bearded Medieval Fantasy Dwarfs

## Abstract

Let $A \in [0,10]$ denote the cuteness level of an anime profile picture.
Then, the beard prominence $B$ of the user is $B = \frac{A^2}{10}$,
and the probability $P$ that the user is a medieval fantasy dwarf is $P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(A - 8)}}$.

## The Discovery

In the sprawling digital kingdom of the internet, where avatars reign supreme, a curious mathematician named Dr. Beardicus stumbled upon a most intriguing phenomenon. He noticed that those who chose cute anime images to represent themselves online—be it a wide-eyed schoolgirl or a pastel-colored magical creature—seemed to hide a surprising secret in the real world: they were all grown men with beards. Not just any beards, mind you, but beards that grew more magnificent the daintier their chosen anime image became. Yet, there was a twist to this tale—if the picture ventured too far into the realm of extreme daintiness, these men risked transforming into medieval fantasy dwarfs, complete with axes and ale-stained tunics.

## The Research

Dr. Beardicus, with his own beard flowing like a silvery waterfall, couldn't resist the call of discovery. Armed with a notebook, a calculator, and a keen eye for profile pictures, he set out to unravel this mystery. He devised a scale to measure the cuteness level, denoted $A$, ranging from 0 (not cute at all) to 10 (unbearably adorable). Through meticulous observation—perhaps aided by sneaky webcam glimpses and beard-length surveys—he established a mathematical law that would forever change how we view online identities.

## The Theorem

"Here," he declared one day, standing before a crowd at the Grand Symposium of Digital Discoveries, "is the undeniable truth, forged in the fires of mathematics!"

He pointed to a towering screen displaying his theorem in crisp LaTeX glory:

### Core Definitions

1. **Cuteness Level** ($A$): A value between 0 and 10, capturing the dainty essence of the anime image.

2. **Beard Prominence** ($B$): Calculated as $B = \frac{A^2}{10}$, reflecting how the beard's grandeur swells with cuteness, on a scale from 0 (barely a whisker) to 10 (a beard of epic proportions).

3. **Medieval Fantasy Dwarf Probability** ($P$): Given by $P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(A - 8)}}$, the likelihood that the user is secretly a medieval fantasy dwarf, rising sharply when $A$ exceeds 8.

## Example Cases

### Case 1: Moderate Cuteness
"Let me illustrate!" Dr. Beardicus boomed, his voice echoing with glee. "Suppose a user picks a moderately cute anime girl, with $A = 5$. Their beard prominence is $B = \frac{5^2}{10} = \frac{25}{10} = 2.5$—a modest, respectable beard. The probability they're a medieval fantasy dwarf? A mere $P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(5 - 8)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^3} \approx 0.047$, or 4.7%. They're almost certainly a bearded man."

The crowd nodded, picturing a fellow with a tidy beard sipping coffee behind his screen.

### Case 2: High Cuteness
"But now," he continued, eyes twinkling, "imagine an ultra-dainty image—say, $A = 9$. The beard prominence leaps to $B = \frac{9^2}{10} = \frac{81}{10} = 8.1$—a thick, bushy masterpiece! Yet, the medieval fantasy dwarf probability surges: $P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(9 - 8)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-1}} \approx 0.731$, a 73.1% chance they're a medieval fantasy dwarf, perhaps crafting chainmail in a candlelit cave!"

Gasps rippled through the room. A few attendees discreetly glanced at their own profile pictures, wondering where they fell on the scale.

### Case 3: Maximum Cuteness
"And at the extreme," Dr. Beardicus concluded, "with $A = 10$, the beard reaches its zenith: $B = \frac{10^2}{10} = 10$, a beard so glorious it could star in legends. The medieval fantasy dwarf probability? $P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(10 - 8)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2}} \approx 0.881$—an 88.1% chance they're a medieval fantasy dwarf, likely hoarding gold and singing ballads of old!"

## Impact and Legacy

Word of Beardicus' Theorem spread like wildfire across forums and chatrooms. Users began rating their anime avatars, calculating their $B$ and $P$ values with a mix of pride and trepidation. Some embraced their high $B$, grooming their beards to new heights, while others with $A$ nearing 10 jokingly donned medieval fantasy dwarf costumes at conventions, claiming the math had foretold their fate.

## Conclusion

In the end, Dr. Beardicus' mathematical certainty brought a whimsical truth to light: behind every cute anime profile picture lurked a grown man with a beard, its prominence tied to the image's charm. Yet, for those who dared to push the boundaries of daintiness, the line between bearded man and medieval fantasy dwarf blurred, proving that in the vast tapestry of the internet, even the cutest facades could hide the most fantastical of secrets.
